<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App
This app requires you to set an ENV variable called API. To get this started on your local machine, please create a .env file in the root directory and add the backend URL like this:

<!-- REACT_APP_API=http://localhost:3000 -->

<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). --> -->
## Project initialization:

Project is initialized with: npx create-react-app boxoffice-frontend. To work with redux you need to add redux through npm add redux.
You start by creating store first inside the index.js file. Import neccessary files from react-redux. It should look similar to this:


import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import {createStore, applyMiddleware, compose} from 'redux'
import reducer from './redux/reducer'
import {Provider} from 'react-redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
import {BrowserRouter as Router} from 'react-router-dom'


const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;
const store = createStore(reducer, composeEnhancers( applyMiddleware(thunk)
));

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
   <Router><Provider store={store}> <App /></Provider></Router>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();

## Structure:

You need to add action creator file where you put your functions and dispatch them to store and reducers. App needs to be structured based on containers and its components. 

## Redux:

Redux helps to useHooks for example, useEffect and useState to build the app which makes it easy to build app using functional components and use state inside them. State is stored in a global object store which makes it easy for any component to access data from store.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
